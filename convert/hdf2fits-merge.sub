# HTCondor submit description file template to process the
# merging of all datasets of an HDF group into a FITS Table.
#
# The file sequence at the "queue" command below
# represents the input data files to be processed
# as individual jobs.
# The name of the group to be converted is specified
# via the GROUP keyword below.
#
# From each input file the filename base is constructed
# in the actual processing shell script (see below) and
# the extension .fits will be added for the output file.
#
# For each individual job also a jobname is constructed
# to identify individual jobs on the batch system.
# This jobname is also used in the naming of the log files,
# together with the Cluster and Process name. 
#
# The actual shell script for processing is contained
# in the file hdf2fits-merge.sh, which in turn invokes
# the file hdf2fits-group.py containing the python script.
#
# In order to launch the batch execution, the files
# hdf2fits-merge.sh and hdf2fits-merge.py have to reside
# in the directory from which this script is invoked.
#
# To launch the job(s) issue the command ($ = prompt) :
#
# $ condor_submit hdf2fits-merge.sub
#
# All log files will be returned into the (working aka host)
# directory from which the job was launched.
