06-may-2011 NvE Creation of the physics directory in the NCFS repository and the ROOT macro grbmodel.cc added
                in the directory /macros.
06-sep-2012 NvE Fix introduced in grbmodel.cc to prevent overfluctuation of the number of GRB muons
                in case the user has selected the non-fluctuation mode (grbnu<0).
                Thanks Lionel Brayeur.
02-mar-2020 NvE ROOT macro burst-model.cc introduced to provide a generic tool to study (astrophysical)
                transient phenomena using the NcAstrolab facility. The latter has recently been extended
                to contain the functionality of the previous (and now obsolete) grbmodel.cc macro.
28-mar-2023 NvE ROOT macro jet-gen.cc introduced to provide a tool to model particle production in
                an (obscured) astrophysical Jet. Also the files jet-gen.sh and jet-gen.sub are added
                to run jet-gen.cc as an HTCondor job.
                The produced data Tree can be analysed by the ROOT macro jet-ana.cc.
11-dec-2023 NvE ROOT macro GRBweb2Root.cc introduced to provide a tool to convert the summary table
                of Paul Coppin's GRBweb facility into a plain ROOT Tree.
