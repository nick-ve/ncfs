rem *   Script to create an MSVC++ LIB and relocatable DLL from *.cxx files
rem *
rem * Usage :
rem * -------
rem * mklibs export : ROOT loadable DLL and export LIB are created
rem * mklibs full   : ROOT loadable DLL and full LIB version are created
rem * 
rem * Notes :
rem * -------
rem * 1) "mklibs export" is the default, enabling ROOT loadable library creation
rem *    via 'double clicking'.
rem *
rem * 2) Providing unsupported options results in displaying the help info.  
rem *
rem * 3) An environment variable NCFS has to be set, pointing to the
rem *    location where the NCFS top level directory is residing.  
rem *
rem * This script creates icepack.lib and icepack.dll from all .h and .cxx files
rem * in the current directory.
rem *
rem * In view of the ROOTCINT processing, the following two standard files
rem * are always required :
rem *
rem * ICEHeaders.h : containing an include of all .h files
rem * ICELinkDef.h : containing the #pragma's to define all classes
