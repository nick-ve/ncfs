14-sep-2006 NvE IceCalibrate.cxx updated to correctly process multiple waveforms and hits per OM.
                Also some calibration constants dropped from OM data words in IceCalibrate,
                since these values are also stored as parameters in the corresponding
                (de)calibration functions.                 
22-sep-2006 NvE IceDwalk extended for specification of maximum number of hits per OM,
                to allow comparison with Sieglinde (which only uses the first OM hit).
                Also IceDwalk now introduces a device into the event named "IceDwalk"
                which contains the values of all the used reconstruction parameters.

                and automatic introduction of a device into the event named "IceLinefit"
                which contains the values of all the used reconstruction parameters and
                the beta value (v/c) of the reconstructed track.
16-nov-2006 NvE Class IceDwalk renamed to IceDwalkx to provide a Sieglinde-like direct
                walk-II approach. The remaining class IceDwalk will provide a more
                sophisticated approach with more physics driven selection criteria.
23-nov-2006 NvE Improved version of IceDwalk installed. Note that the old algorithm is
                still available as IceDwalkx.

                IceCalibrate.cxx and IceXtalk.cxx updated to support both the old (MuDaq only)
                and new (MuDaq, TWRDaq, ...) calibration file format.
                Also isolation cut in IceCleanHits modified to ignore hits from
                the same OM.
05-jun-2007 NvE Search for attached dbase performed only once in the Exec() memberfunction
                of IceCalibrate and IceXtalk to speed up processing.
06-jun-2007 NvE Explicit tests on null pointers for returned TObjArray* from e.g. GetHits()
                introduced in the .cxx files of IceCalibrate, IceChi2, IceCleanHits, IceDwalk,

                Also the memberfunctions SetMaxModA(), SetMaxModI() etc... of IceLinefit
                have been integrated in memberfunctions SetMaxMod() etc... 
21-nov-2007 NvE (De)calibration functions reset to 0 in IceMakeHits to indicate uncalibrated
                data. This will allow correct re-processing of IceMakeHits on already calibrated
                signals.
02-dec-2007 NvE New memberfunctions GetNstrings() introduced in IceEvent.
04-dec-2007 NvE New quality value based on both associated hits and strings introduced
                in IceDwalk. The user can select between various modes via the new

27-dec-2007 NvE Installation scripts adapted to the use of the environment variable RALICE
                instead of ALIROOT.
28-dec-2007 NvE IcePandel.cxx and IceChi2.cxx modified to treat Amanda (OM), InIce (DOM)
                or combined tracks separately. The UseHits default has been changed to the
                new mode=2 facility. See the class docs for details. 
03-may-2008 NvE Typo in IcePandel.cxx corrected to test on "eta" instead of "tres" for
                regions 3 and 4 (thanks to David Boersma).
30-may-2008 NvE Include of "Math/SpecFuncMathMore.h" replaced by generic "Math/SpecFunc.h"
                in IcePandel.h and IceChi2.h to comply with new ROOT convention.

10-feb-2010 NvE IceCleanHits.h and IceCleanHits.cxx modified to incorporate extensions and optimisations.
                Also IceMakeHits.h and IceMakeHits.cxx modified to incorporate the tuning for IceCube
                waveform hit extraction as performed by Dennis Diederix.
                Also some new example macros (e.g. hit statistics etc.) introduce in the macros directory.
11-feb-2010 NvE File gcclib.sh in /scripts modified to incorporate use of the NCFS environment variable.

21-apr-2010 NvE Conditional reconstruction of various detector signals implemented in IceDwalk to enable saving of cpu time.
28-apr-2010 NvE New memberfunction UseWaveformNameI introduced in IceMakeHits to provide more flexibility
                and also baseline determination optimised. Also the saturation check is now only performed
                on the RAW waveforms since the calibrated ones should not contain saturation.
                This recovers again good hits in the CAL-FADC waveforms, which were lost before.
08-jul-2010 NvE New file filt-stat.cc introduced in /macros to provide IceCube filter statistics.
20-jul-2010 NvE IceMakeHits.h and IceMakeHits.cxx modified to incorporate several improvements for IceCube waveform extraction.
17-jan-2011 NvE File hit-stat.cc updated and file hit-stat.cxx added in /macros to provide IceCube hit data
                in plain ROOT tree format for an in-depth investigation of hit statistics.  
25-feb-2011 NvE Functionality of IceLinefit extended to support now also "IC" and "DC" tracks next to "I" and "A".
                Also the actual linefit reconstruction is now performed by a central module which is invoked
                by the various detector configurations. 
21-apr-2011 NvE IceDwalk derived from IceLinefit to allow usage of common memberfunctions and the docs of
                both classes updated accordingly. 
20-may-2011 NvE Macros trig-stat.cc and filt-stat.cc updated in /macros to protect against division by 0 in case dt=0.
                In file filt-stat.cc now always a signal is added (even if it is 0) in order to have all available
                filters listed, via Data(), in the statistics at the end.  
22-jun-2011 NvE Library creation scripts for Alpha, AMD, HP and Mac updated in /scripts to use the NCFS environment variable.
15-jul-2011 NvE Files hit-stat.cc and hit-stat.cxx updated in /macros to enable also analysis of sDST data. 
21-jul-2011 NvE File hit-stat.cxx updated in /macros in order not to skip entries without hits.
                In this way the (new) feature of the TTreeViewer entry slider bar can be used to obtain a direct
                comparison with the actual IcePack input data in an individual event analysis.
03-jan-2012 NvE Typos corrected in storing device parameter values for IceCleanHits.
                NcSignal changed into NcDevice to hold the parameter settings for all the tasks, which provides
                a more consistent use of nomenclature and allows a future restriction to devices of the AddDevice()
                and GetDevice() memberfunctions of NcEvent.
                This change has been made in the Exec() memberfunctions of IceCalibrate, IceChi2, IceCleanHits,
                IceDwalk, IceDwalkx, IceLinefit and IceMakeHits.
11-jan-2012 NvE Funcionality of IceEvent::GetTriggerTime() extended. 
02-feb-2012 NvE More correct suppression of (TSpectrum) warning/error messages and re-activation of previous
                info level in IceMakeHits.
07-feb-2012 NvE IceCleanHits updated by enabling multiple "trigger times" to allow correct processing of multiple
                tracks within one single event and time window settings for IceCube updated accordingly.
                This extension became possible via the new features of IceEvent::GetTriggerTime(). 
                Also no selection is made anymore on ADC or TOT for IceCube hits in the cleaning.
02-may-2012 NvE File filt-stat.cc updated in /macros to provide also the various filtered event rates.
03-may-2012 NvE File filt-stat.cc updated in /macros to extend the functionality with user selective suppression
                of various filter channels to study possible background reduction for specific analyses.
04-may-2012 NvE File trig-stat.cc updated in /macros to extend the functionality with user selective suppression
                of various trigger channels to study possible background reduction for specific analyses.
12-jul-2012 NvE New memberfunction GetTimeResidual() introduced in class IceGOM.
13-jul-2012 NvE Class IceDwalk made more modular and functionality extended and fine tuned.
                The previous version of IceDwalk is still available as IceDwalkx.
18-jul-2012 NvE Optional flipping of track direction introduced in IceLinefit and IceDwalk to enable further
                reduction of the background for upgoing tracks due to mis-reconstructed downgoing muons.
11-nov-2012 NvE Flipping of track direction de-activated by default in IceLinefit and IceDwalk since it was seen
                that with previous defaults thetatrk=90 and thetahits=100 too many upgoing signal events were lost.
07-jan-2013 NvE Memberfunctions GetNmodules() introduced in IceEvent and memberfunctions GetNstrings() optimised for speed. 
19-jan-2013 NvE New reconstruction base class IceRecoBase introduced and ICEHeaders.h and ICELinkDef.h updated accordingly.
                This new IceRecoBase is now used as a base class for IceLinefit, IceDwalk and IcePandel.
24-jan-2013 NvE Memberfunction SetSingleHit() moved from IceDwalk to IceRecoBase and also the default settings
                for single hit switching in the IceDwalk constructor modified.
27-feb-2013 NvE Backward link to the track introduced for all Pandel track associated hits.  
15-mar-2013 NvE Memberfunction GetStringMax() introduced in IceEvent.
                Support for maximum number of (D)OMs on a single string introduced in IceRecoBase::SetSingleHit()
                and IceDwalk updated to use this new feature.
17-mar-2013 NvE Values of return arguments in IceEvent::GetStringMax() initialised to 0 so that all returned values
                will be 0 in case their were no requested (D)OMs firing.
27-mar-2014 NvE Files filt-stat.cxx and run.cc added to /macros
15-jul-2016 NvE Memberfunction IceEvent::Reset() introduced.
19-mar-2021 NvE Compiler option -Wall replaced by -Wunused in the amdgcclib.sh compilation script
                to prevent excessive warnings with the new(er) gcc versions.
20-jun-2021 NvE Unused variable "twrdaq" removed from IceXtalk::Exec() to prevent compiler warning.
07-may-2025 NvE An incompatibility was introduced starting from ROOT6, consisting of the fact that the Float_t* return arguments
                were changed into Double_t* in class TSpectrum.
                To resolve this issue, a class NcSpectrum was introduced, which actually is the code of TSpectrum as it
                was present in ROOT 5.34/38.
                The only memberfunction that was affected was IceEvent::GetTriggerTime(), and as such the files IceEvent.h and IceEvent.cxx
                were updated accordingly. This makes this icepack version both backward compatible and forward compatible with ROOT6. 
                The version indicator in NcVersion has been updated to 5.41.
                *** Note : NCFS versions up to 5.41 (incl.) will NOT yet be compatible with ROOT6 because of lacking Pythia6 support ***
27-may-2025 NvE The docs sections in the .h and .cxx files were modified, such that they satisfy both the THtml and Doxygen format. 
29-may-2025 NvE TSpectrum replaced by NcSpectrum in class IceMakeHits, in order to stay consistent. 
10-sep-2025 NvE All //!< strings in all .h files replaced by ///<! to indicate variables that should not be written
                to a ROOT file, and still be compatible with the Doxygen conventions.
                It turned out that //!< resulted in errors when reading old ROOT files.
