03-may-2021 NvE First implementation of the RnoPack package as a subdirectory of NCFS.
09-jul-2021 NvE Introduction of class RnoConvert to convert RNO-G data into RnoEvent structures.
                RnoConvert updated to make use of the newly introduced NcSample facility
                that allows to reduce the data volume.  
10-jul-2021 NvE Cleanup of code and docs in RnoGANT and also the docs of RnoDetector updated.
                Also the memberfunction DisplayWaveform() introduced in RnoStation, RnoDetector and RnoEvent.
11-jul-2021 NvE Memberfunction DisplayWaveform() replaced by DisplaySampling() and DisplaySamplings()
                to provide more flexibility and to comply with the intended distinction between
                Samples and Waveforms as outlined in the docs of NcSignal.
                Also the Run and Event number are indicated at each sampling display when the
                display is produced via invokation of the RnoEvent memberfunctions.
                For all sampling displays a grid is now also shown.
