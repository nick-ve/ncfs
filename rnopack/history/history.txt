03-may-2021 NvE First implementation of the RnoPack package as a subdirectory of NCFS.
09-jul-2021 NvE Introduction of class RnoConvert to convert RNO-G data into RnoEvent structures.
                RnoConvert updated to make use of the newly introduced NcSample facility
                that allows to reduce the data volume.  
10-jul-2021 NvE Cleanup of code and docs in RnoGANT and also the docs of RnoDetector updated.
                Also the memberfunction DisplayWaveform() introduced in RnoStation, RnoDetector and RnoEvent.
11-jul-2021 NvE Memberfunction DisplayWaveform() replaced by DisplaySampling() and DisplaySamplings()
                to provide more flexibility and to comply with the intended distinction between
                Samples and Waveforms as outlined in the docs of NcSignal.
                Also the Run and Event number are indicated at each sampling display when the
                display is produced via invokation of the RnoEvent memberfunctions.
                For all sampling displays a grid is now also shown.
16-jul-2021 NvE New facility GetDayTimeString() used in RnoEvent to include also the event date/time info
                in the display of the memberfunctions DisplaySampling() and DisplaySamplings().
29-jul-2021 NvE Bug fix : Variable fCanvas set to 0 in the copy constructor of class RnoStation to prevent
                the possible occurence of a segmenation violation.
                Also class RnoConvert modified to handle data files in which waveforms, header and daqstatus are combined.
25-nov-2021 NvE Channel numbering 21 and 23 swapped in RnoDetector::CreateStation to comply with the actual
                deployed hardware in which Ch21 is an Hpol and Ch23 is a Vpol antenna on Helper string 2.
01-dec-2021 NvE Class RnoConvert extended to handle also pedestal data files and a separate
                member function RnoConvert::ListInput() introduced.
17-dec-2021 NvE Creation of a device "DAQ" introduced in class RnoConvert to indicate the RADIANT and FLOWER
                firmware updates.
22-dec-2021 NvE In RnoConvert the devices "DAQ" and "Trigger" are now added to an RnoStation instead of
                the top detector structure, since they relate to the individual station settings.
                Also the DAQ sampling rate is now indicated in the DAQ device. 
                Display functionality of RnoStation and RnoEvent extended and new member functions
                GetSampleGraph() and GetSampleDFT() introduced.
06-jan-2022 NvE RnoConvert adapted to only write out events that have a proper event selection level
                based on event selections that were processed via sub-tasks.
07-jan-2022 NvE Functionality of event selection level extended in RnoConvert and version indication
                removed from the constructor, since this is now done in the NcJob constructor.
                ROOT macro convert.cc in folder /macros updated to reflect extended RnoConvert functionality.
05-jul-2022 NvE Functionality of RnoGANT::GetNumber() extended to provide also the DAQ channel number.
11-jul-2022 NvE New class RnoMonitor introduced and the ROOT macro convert.cc in folder /macros extended
                to include a monitor task in the processing. Also a standalone ROOT macro analyze.cc added
                in folder /macros to serve as an example to investigate files containing RnoEvent structures.
                Furthermore, a folder /condor-jobs has been added in which several HTCondor job templates
                are provided to process RNO-G data.
20-jul-2022 NvE Storage of processor parameters in the RnoEvent structure replaced by just some printout
                at the first invokation of RnoMonitor::Exec().
26-jul-2022 NvE Treatment of trigger info extended in RnoConvert.cxx.
01-aug-2022 NvE Data retrieval completely based on looping over the Leaf list in order to be
                completely independent of the data Tree c.q. Branch structure in RnoConvert.cxx.
16-nov-2022 NvE Functionality of RnoMonitor extended with the monitoring statistics RMSdeviation,
                SpreadMean and SpreadMedian and memberfunction DefineCentralValue() renamed to
                DefineStatistic(). The corresponding example macros have been updated accordingly.
17-nov-2022 NvE In RnoConvert::Exec() the leaves list is now updated for each individual Tree in the TChain
                in order to avoid memory problems which were encountered when processing many data files in
                a stacked fashion.
19-dec-2022 NvE Functionality of RnoMonitor extended by introduction of the memberfunction SetBaselineMode()
                and the memberfunction SetDeviceClass() renamed to SetDevices() to provide more flexibility.
                The corresponding example macros have been updated accordingly.
11-jan-2023 NvE Functionality of RnoConvert::SetPrintFreq() extended by introduction of a print level.
03-feb-2023 NvE The class RnoStation has been modified to use the new class NcDSP.
08-mar-2023 NvE New member function RnoMonitor::SetBandFilters() introduced to support selections in the
                frequency domain.
